Before the joystick can be used, the user must first connect to the robot. This can be done in a number of ways, however, the easiest option is to either simply click 'connect' or move the joystick.

To connect to the robot, select the 'Web Bluetooth' option. Then select your device (in the video below, the device name is 'Pixl.js fc86').
When 'pair' is selected, the browser will then attempt to connect to your device - this may take a couple of seconds.
