# _Project Evaluation - Participant Brief_

Hi! Thank you for volunteering to be part of my user evaluation for my project!

So what is it? My project is to create a competition for a self-driving robot, and then submit an entry into this competition. You’ll be asked to evaluate two products today:
* The first is the robot controller (the entry into the competition). This controller provides a way to control a connected robot, both manually, and autonomously, by providing it with the necessary features to drive itself.
* The second is the competition. The competition has multiple parts to it (such as a website and a physical track). However, today, you’ll only be asked to evaluate the website.

This evaluation will ask you to complete a series of tasks, followed by a short questionnaire at the end. I will be observing you using the controller, but don’t worry, I’m not evaluating your performance! I’m just taking notes on how you use the product.

Provided with the controller is a link to the user manual. <br>
__Please feel free to consult the user manual for help with any of these tasks.__

When you’re ready to begin, please navigate to the controller via the link below, then complete the following stages. <br>

## Stage 1
Your first task is to navigate to the Joystick page. Upon reaching this page, you will be given 5 minutes to explore the controller and joystick. You are free to do whatever you want in this phase. Some recommendations are:
* Connect to the robot
* Use the joystick to manually control the robot
* Change the settings of the robot
* Consult the user manual for help on how to perform specific actions

When 5 minutes have passed, you will move to the next stage.

## Stage 2
Please perform the following actions:
* Set the send code speed to 100 ms.
* Choose a tight angle-motor mapping
* Reset the code on the robot
* Upload new code onto the robot

## Stage 3
You will now be asked to navigate the robot around an __object__ (roughly 2 metres away) and back using the __joystick__. Before doing this, please make sure you’re using the __tight angle-motor mapping__.

You will now be asked to do the same, however this time using the __loose angle-motor mapping__.

<br>

<br>

## Stage 4
You will now be asked to navigate the robot through a __slalom__ and back using the __joystick__. Before doing this, please make sure you’re using the __tight angle-motor mapping__.

You will now be asked to do the same, however this time using the __loose angle-motor mapping__.

## Stage 5
You will now be asked to navigate the robot around an __object__ (roughly 2 metres away) and back using the __Virtual Lead__ feature. Before doing this, please make sure you’re using the __tight angle-motor mapping__.

_Feel free to refer to the user manual to do this._

## Stage 6
You will now be asked to navigate the robot through a slalom and back using the __Virtual Lead__ feature. Before doing this, please make sure you’re using the __tight angle-motor mapping__.

_Feel free to refer to the user manual to do this._

## Stage 7
You will now be asked to navigate to the following website. This website is supposed to serve as a way to inform people about the competition. Please if you could spend no more than five minutes looking through the website and note that the website uses the name _‘UofG Cup’_ to refer to the competition - this is simply a placeholder name and would most likely not refer to the final product. <br>
