## User Study Description
In order to evaluate the competition and controller, a user study was conducted.

Overall, 10 participants took part in the study over the course of one week. The study was broken down into several stages - each assessing different parts of the project. 

The first were exploratory stages, which asked the user to explore different features of the controller. The purpose of this was to get the user familiar with the basic concepts of how to use the controller, in hopes of eliminating any learning bias in the later stages. Additionally, these stages asked the users to change various settings of the robot, in order to evaluate its ease-of-use.

The following stages asked participants to navigate the robot around some obstacles using both the manual control and Virtual Lead feature. Following this, participants were asked to view the competition website for a short period of time. Finally, participants were given a questionnaire to complete, asking questions on their experience using the controller and viewing the website.
 
Throughout the entire study, participants were continually prompted to consult the user manual if they so needed. Additionally, they were observed completing these tasks, to observe details regarding how the tasks were completed, such as how many obstacles they collided with, and the task completion time.

## Data Gathering
### Ethics Checklist
This project was evaluated using a user study, which involved human participants. Please click here for the [Ethics Checklist](./ethics/ethics-checklist.pdf).

### Briefing
All participants were read a [Participant Brief](./participant-brief.md) beforehand adhering to ethical guidelines. This informed them of the following:
* the general aim of the experiment
* why we need the involvement of other people
* what will happen in the experiment
* what data will be collected
* what interaction they may have with us during the experiment
* this was no a test of their ability
* they could withdraw at any time
* they must give their explicit consent to participate
* they can ask any questions

After the experiment, they were then read a [Participant Debrief](./participant-debrief.md), which informed them of the following:
* the main aim of the experiment
* they could ask more questions
* contact details
* thanks for taking part

### GDPR
In order to remain GDPR compliant, no personally identifiable information was collected - participants are simply referred to as "participant 1", "participant 2", etc.
