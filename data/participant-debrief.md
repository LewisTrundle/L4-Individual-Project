# _Project Evaluation - Participant Debrief_

Thank you so much for taking part in the user study today. It really helps us a lot!

To reiterate, the purpose of this user study was to assess the usability of the controller in its ability to provide efficient manual and autonomous control over a robot.

Please feel free to ask any more questions.

Once again, thank you so much for taking time today to complete this study!
